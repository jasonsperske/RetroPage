RetroPage
=========

A simple web server devoted to setting up a RetoPie over a network (cutting down the number
of things you need to have setup to use the awesome RetoPie project).  Basically it is a web
front-end like a WiFi Router (or modern Printers).  This is not designed (at present) to be
secure just easy.

To start this project up simply run (RetroPage is programmed to request port 1980):

    nohud python RetroPage.py &

Then access your RetroPie from any web browser at:

    http://[ip address of RetroPie]:1980/
